# Why The Campaign

__*With such a strong foundation in the Lord, the Gospel and the authority of Scripture, I believe the Lord has amazing plans ahead for The Orchard. I believe we are in a unique season in which we are preparing for what He has in store for us and how He plans to use us in our community and beyond.*__

There is solid and growing leadership, there is strong commitment from the body demonstrated in faithful love for one another, prayer, service to the body, attendance and financial support.

As the elders pray about where God is leading, we are continually directed to strengthening the body and reaching others with the Good News of Jesus Christ. Our vison is still the same: Making Fully Functioning Followers of Jesus; Rooted in Hope and Branching Out to the World. Increasingly, we feel a part of this vision possibly involves being in a new location which is more visible to the community, is able to be used to serve the community better and is closer to a neighborhood. It would also be a location and building which has designated space for children to play inside the church and outside.  It has been interesting to learn that from the beginning of purchasing our current building, it was always considered a stepping stone to a permanent location that functions better for what we feel called to be about.

Yet, even as we dream about this possibility, even as land is available to purchase in locations which may suit these desires well, even as we are healthy in so many ways…we have a major obstacle at this time.

It was shortly after the initial purchase of our Ridgeview location that the church went through some difficult times. As was noted earlier, many families left and finances for the church were tenuous shortly after the purchase. Even as Converge stepped in and helped restore order and health, even as the church grew under the leadership of Tim Beavis, more space was needed and an additional loan taken out for the Family Ministry Center. Currently, this leaves us with a very large mortgage, one which precludes us entertaining the idea of a new land purchase however exciting, however affordable, however functional it might be. In July, 2011 both of these mortgage loans we refinanced directly through Converge. At that time, it was the largest loan Converge had ever given out. On one hand, this may seem discouraging, but on the other it demonstrates yet again how much Converge believes in The Orchard and God’s plans for this local church.

It is the elders’ view, after much prayer and discussion, that the current situation we find ourselves in calls for us to address it with intentionality and sacrifice.

We believe our mortgage debt is limiting our opportunities as a church and, while it may have been necessary at the time, it is not God-honoring today. It is time to be about the work of Tending The Orchard, to clear away that which is hindering so we may continue to grow and bear much fruit.

So, we are proposing to engage in a Capital Campaign for the purpose of mortgage debt elimination and corporate spiritual growth. This will:
Align us with a Biblical perspective on debt
Fulfill our financial commitment to Converge who has extended the loan
Create flexibility for the church in the future

Through this process I believe we will:
Experience personal spiritual growth as we give sacrificially to the Lord
Experience growth in fellowship as we sacrifice together for the Lord

We realize this is no small task. We also realize that if we are faithfully following where the Lord is leading we are sure to be successful. This will require everyone being involved. Involved in prayer. Involved in helping serve. Involved in sacrificial giving. Some will be able to give more, others less. But all can sacrifice equally.


Here is exciting news. Successful completion of this campaign will free $60,000 a year we currently allocate to mortgage payments. Payments which are scheduled through June 2041. Instead, we will complete repayment of the mortgage at the end of the 3-year Capital Campaign. Not only will this free that $60,000 dollars annually…money currently allocated to our mortgage, it will save over $500,000 in interest payments accrued over the natural course of the original loan. Imagine how God might use the financial freedom our church will gain! Imagine, years from now, looking with amazement at how the Lord ministers in new and exciting ways to us, to our children, and to families that are yet to be planted at The Orchard because of the faithfulness of us today.

Here are some specifics of how our mortgage currently stands and how the Capital Campaign will change it:

In addition to how The Orchard will be blessed by this, the Kingdom of God will be also. By repaying the loan to Converge, we allow them to reallocate those dollars to churches who are financially struggling or who are expanding their kingdom impact through church multiplication…churches who may be in need of assistance just as we were. We will also be investing in Kingdom Building, even as we work to eliminate our debt, by dedicating 10% to Converge to be placed in their matching grant fund for church plants. Church planting is and will always be a part of Branching Out! We are but one of many orchards the master has.



How exactly does this look? How does this breakdown? Well, as mentioned earlier…through equal sacrifice.
