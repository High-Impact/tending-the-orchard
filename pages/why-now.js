# Why Now

__*In early 2018, Pastor Tim Beavis was called to serve at Carey Outreach Ministries. On Easter Sunday, April 1, 2018, Pastor Scott began serving as senior pastor at The Orchard.*__

Currently, we are in an overall healthy place as a church. Attendance is solid, anchored by many faithful families who love the Lord and believe in the vision of The Orchard; namely, to make Fully Functioning Followers of Jesus; Rooted in Hope and Branching Out to the World. There is a great love for the Lord that is clear and apparent. There is a continued hunger to grow deeper in the knowledge of Scripture. There is a passion to serve and minister to others. While there is a potential for uncertainty to exist when change of leadership occurs, in fact, the opposite has happened. The rule of Christ over this church, The Orchard, and the recognition of this important truth by the body is the clear reason for this.

In a season of change, spiritual growth is occurring in exciting ways. Financially, we are in a solid and healthy place, both keeping operating costs down and meeting budget by the faithful and generous financial partnership of the body. Worship is authentic and excellent, led by Aaron Netsell. A wonderful part of his ministry is the way he invests in others on the worship team, a team which is growing in number and in skill. The leadership of the elders and other ministry leads is fantastic. Their hearts for the Lord, for Scripture and for the body is evident in the servant attitudes they display.

Jesus said, “By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 3:35). This is one of the hallmark characteristics of a follower of Jesus. This, also, is one of the hallmarks of The Orchard. Amazing growth is happening in this area. This goes a long way beyond friendliness on a Sunday. There is a clear love for one another that is expressed and experienced in tangible ways outside the walls of the church. People are serving one another in increasing measure. At the same time, there is an increase in the number of people serving the body in various ministries as well. This is yet another sign of the health of The Orchard. Many are taking on new or increased responsibilities, ministering to one another, building one another up, just as Scripture calls us to do.

During this time, we continue to have impact in many areas outside the church as well. With a strong heart for missions, The Orchard continues to send teams to Crum, WV to minister with Crum Missionary Baptist Church to communities on both sides of the Kentucky-WV border. Additionally, we continue to support Dustin and Maranda Mahoney as they serve in Genoa, Italy as well as the church planting and mission ministries of Converge. Our relationship with Real Love Ministries International in Lafito, Haiti remains strong and vital to both their health and ours. The amount of lives, in Lafito and the McHenry area, that have been impacted through this ministry and the magnitude of that impact is not easily put into words. This ministry has been a shaping influence of our church even as we have sought to bless Real Love. Recently, we have begun a relationship with Lee and Regina Block as they serve in southern Brazil and have become a supporting church for Tim Beavis in his new ministry. Indeed, the Lord has blessed us with hearts for missions and wonderful opportunities to partner with like-minded individuals and ministries who have a heart to present the Gospel boldly and faithfully.

Yet, like all families, we face our challenges. On the home front, missions has been a bit more difficult. While we have many people serving the community in various ways, as a church, we have not engaged as much or as effectively as we would like. There is great potential for us to have an impact in this community God has placed us in.

To be sure, our location presents some challenges to us, both in making a visible presence in the community and even as we seek to minister to the families that call The Orchard home. We are thankful for the building the Lord has entrusted to us and the space is used well, but it does present some limitations. We are blessed with many children! Currently, about 25% of the attendance on a Sunday is 8th grade or under. There is no outdoor space for these children to run or play, relegating those activities to inside the building. Inside, the situation is not much different. The Family Ministry Center is fantastic and multi-functional, but does not double well as a gym…especially when other activities in the church are going on. In addition to this challenge, our building is difficult to find. It can even be difficult to recognize as a church when someone pulls into the parking lot.
