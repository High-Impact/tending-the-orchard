# Testimonies

__*In the Spring of 1994, a small group of Christ followers began to meet together for Bible study and worship, sensing God’s call to plant a new church.*__

Momentum grew and out of the faithfulness, obedience and sacrifice of this small group God blessed and grew them in number and maturity. By September, they began renting a space at 4041 Albany in McHenry, IL and officially incorporated as StoneRidge Community Church on December 21, 1994.

Over the next 10 years, the church rented various schools around McHenry to worship. In 2003, the church began their partnership with the Baptist General Conference (now called Converge). This partnership would prove to be a blessing to both parties and critically important to the church.

In 2004, a bold move was made and the property we currently worship in at 768 Ridgeview Dr. was purchased. Initially, this included only the sanctuary and office sides of our current facility.

2005-2007 would prove to be challenging years for the church. Two lead pastors resigned under difficult circumstances and many families left the church. Attendance decreased dramatically. During this time, the name of the church was changed from StoneRidge to The Orchard and officially underwent a “re-start”. At this critical time, believing in the Lord’s purpose for The Orchard, Converge stepped in to provide key leadership and support. This included supplying an interim to preach, help searching for a new pastor and a continued presence serving on an advisory team for The Orchard.


This would prove to be key as the Lord began to bring stability and health back to The Orchard. After a successful church plant in Rogers Park, on the north side of Chicago, Converge helped bring Tim Beavis to The Orchard in August of 2007. Growth began again and to accommodate the needs of the body the portion of the building with Family Ministry Center was purchased and dedicated on October 2008. Less than a year later, Scott Swanson joined the pastoral team in July of 2009 as Pastor of Family Ministries.

During the following years, many areas were strengthened such as children’s ministry and worship. A youth ministry developed and missions became a core part of the culture of The Orchard.
